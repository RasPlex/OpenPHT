NEW:
  - Support for upcoming features in the server that is soon announced.
  - Server names are now showed for all sections in the home window by default, they can be
    disabled in Skin settings.

FIXED:
  - Apply some ATMOS support patches. Seems to work better than before, but still not 100%.
  - Fixed warning when navigating Music sections
  - Fixed watch later listing and navigation
  - Fixed cropping in Photo slide show
  - Removed the Now Playing entry from the home window since it was broken in many ways
  - Fixed a crash that could happen if you played the last Episode and unwatched filter was applied
  - Fixed a problem where Android mobile app would show up in the home list even if it was disabled
  - With the next version of the Media Server the transcoding profile will no longer request AC3/DTS audio
    when it's disabled in PHT.
  - HLS transcode streams are now removed since MKV streaming seems to work much better for all scenarios
